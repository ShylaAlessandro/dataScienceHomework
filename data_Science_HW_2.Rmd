# Problem 1 (20 points)

During class you completed an activity in which you practiced `git` commands and operations (such as forking a repository, cloning it using `git clone`, and uploading changes using `git push`).

In this exercise you will used **markdown** tools discussed in class. 

## Part A

You must **create a table** that shows the courses you are currently enrolled in, using the following for the headers of the table: 

- Prefix: in bold letters (such as **COP**)
- Number: in bold letters (such as **2073**)
- Name: in italics (such as _Introduction to Data Science_)
- Credits (such as 3)

| Prefix |Number | Name | Credits |
|:----:|:----:|:------:|:--:|
|**MAC**|**2312**|*Analytic Geometry and Calculus 2*|4|
|**COP**|**2271**|*Introduction to Computation and Programming*|3|
|**COP**|**2073**|*Introduction to Data Science*|3|
|**ISC**|**2310**|*Python for Data Analytics*|3|
## Part B


Take a screenshot of the GitHub repo you used in HW 01, add the screenshot file to the repo, and include it in this document (review how to insert a picture using markdown).

# Problem 2 (30 points)

For this problem, you are asked to create a list of **4 concepts** you have learned about so far this semester. Include the name of the course as a sub-heading (that is, using `##`), and the concepts as an unordered list. Include a link to information about _at least one_ of the concepts you listed (for example a link to the Wikipedia page about that concept/topics).

_Edit this `.Rmd` file to include the solutions here._

## Analytic Geometry and Calculus 2
- [Integration by Parts](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/integration-by-parts.html)
- How to calculate work

## Python for Data Analytics
- Printing messages
- Creating variables

# Problem 3 (25 points)

In this problem you will practice some basic R operations. Include solutions to each items by inserting a new R chunk of code (make sure you run the chunk so that the output is displayed)


(a) Create a variable called `my_name` that contains _your preferred name_.

(b) Create a variable called `name_length` that holds how many letters are in `my_name`.

(c) Show which value is bigger: $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$. (Use the correct expressions for Euler's constant $e$ and the irrational number $\pi$ in R)

(d) Use the colon operator `:` to create a vector `v` of numbers from 31 to 86. Find the length of this vector using the `length()` function.

(e) Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of number from -5 to 10 in 0.5 increments.


```{r}

my_name <- "Shyla"
name_length <- nchar(my_name)
print(name_length)


firstNumber <- exp(1)^pi
secondNumber <- pi^exp(1)

if(firstNumber>secondNumber){
  print("e to the power of pi is greater than pi to the power of e")
}else{
  print("pi to the power of e is greater than e to the power of pi")
}


vector <- 31:86
length(vector)

variable <- seq(-5, 10, 0.5)
print(variable)
```

# Problem 4 (25 points)

(a) (10 points) Define a function `imperial_to_metric` that takes in **two arguments**: a number of feet and a number of inches. The function should return the equivalent length in meters

> To convert a length `L` from feet (`ft`) and inches (`inches`) to meters (`m`), one can use the relation: `L(m) = L(ft) × 0.3048 + L(inches) × 0.0254`
}

```{r}

imperial_to_metric <- function(ft,inch){
  return(((ft*12)+ inch)*0.0254)

}
print(imperial_to_metric)
```


(b) (5 points) Create a variable `height_in_meters` by passing your height in imperial to the `imperial_to_metric` function.

```{r}

height_in_meters <- imperial_to_metric(5,3)
print(height_in_meters)


```

(c) (5 points) Evaluate `round(3.1415)`, `factorial(12)`, `mean(1:17)`.

```{r}

round(3.1415)
factorial(12)
mean(1:17)

```

(d) (5 points) Create an object named `die` that contains the numbers one through six. Simulate a roll of the die with `R`’s `sample()` function. 


```{r}

die <- (1:6)
sample(die,1)

```
